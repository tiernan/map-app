### How to Run Locally with Gulp

Simply, follow the steps below to launch a simple local server:

1. Extract this archive where you desire.
2. First install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).
3. Follow steps 1-5 in your OS's terminal (node.js command line in windows).
3. Install gulp's cli by entering the command `npm install --global gulp-cli`.
4. Navigate to the directory where you extracted the files, then enter the command `npm install`
5. Now to launch a local server, enter `gulp`
6. You should now be able to access the website at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

Once done, press Ctrl + C in the terminal to tell gulp to stop serving.
